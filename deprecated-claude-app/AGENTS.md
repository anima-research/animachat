# Code style

- Always import modules with .js extension.
- Prefer shorter code where possible, e.g. (''+x) instead of String(x)
- Import types as `import`, avoid `import type`
- Keep functions small (under 20 lines) where possible.
- Keep files small (under 100 lines) where possible.
- Functional style is better than loops in simple cases.
