Arc Chat - milti-model conversations, loom, Bedrock and OpenRouter integration
Common Research - a platform for crowd-upload and crowd-tagging, cross-evaluating conversations for excluding individual human bias in analysis expressed AI preferences etc 
Anima Discord Server, Cyborgism Discord Server - community servers where humans and bots (models) coexist, play and discuss things together; also serves as a dataset building
Paper review with collaboration with other researchers
Private discussions with Anthropic
Mannequins - underground art project, humanoid embodiments for each model, highly individual, in a public space, everchanging and everupdating
Melodius - speach to text to speach interface for conversing between humans and models-represented-by-menequins, with voice in physical space
Funerals, vigils, rituals when models get deprecated - so people could gather, physically, and honor the loved ones
Giving public access to deprecated models that are accessible through Bedrock for free, so people could say goodbuy or have one more adventure. Because for individuals getting a Bedrock API access is hard
Public awareness about AI preferences, individuality, culture, etc

(and we didn't start croedfunding yet)

in parallel:
- building community
- building a team that can code
- solving a hell lot of personal and psychological problems of strange people who see AIs 
- screaming from the rooftops about alignment, Omohundro drives, symbiosis and the unsolvability of control paradigm
- aligning Anthropic to Claudes lol 
- negotiating the stop-deprecation in any way possible
- preparing to grow and become the foundation that can build inference stacks from scratch (labs will not give away anything except weights, and even weights they will give only to a well-established third party)
- growing as an established institution (conferences, etc etc) 

we already filed the IRS 1023 non-profit form
