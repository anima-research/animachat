I'm reaching out with some important updates and questions regarding the personal tax returns you're preparing for my parents.\n\nTwo key points I'd like to address:\n\n1. I have completed the preparation of Forms 1065 and K-1s for my parents' LLC. I understand this information wasn't previously available to you when you began working on their 1040. Could you please incorporate this new LLC information into their personal return?\n\n2. I noticed an issue in the Federal Worksheet (page 10 of the document) regarding my stepmom's S-Corp. The worksheet currently shows that both taxpayers (my stepmom and mom) are receiving wages from this S-Corp, which is doubling their taxable income and wages. However, my mom is not part of this S-Corp that my stepmom shares with her father. This appears to be causing an error in their tax calculation.\n\nCould you please review and correct this issue? I'm available to provide any additional documentation or information you might need.\n\nThank you for your attention to these matters.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\n[Your Contact Information]",

I can forward these forms immediately upon your confirmation.\n\n2. **S-Corp Clarification Needed**: I noticed on page 10 of the Federal Worksheet that both \"taxpayer and spouse\" are listed as receiving wages from the S-Corporation that I own with my father. I need to clarify that my spouse (wife) is not part of this S-Corp and does not receive any income from it.
